/* HINDSIGHT OVERVIEW / RESUME INFORMATION

Another idea that I never got around to. Concept was combining mech combat with modular component-based damage modeling,
so that the player would need to quickly fix key modules mid-combat. Coulda been an interesting twist on the genre,
making the player choose between key functionality of their mech, and rewarding dexterity in quickly repairing 
their modules via minigame or something. I plan to get back to this one, but probably not with raylib.
